    <h2>Irish Oysters</h2>
    <p>Find below a short update on oyster shells which I recently analysed for Chris Hunt (University of Liverpool) and one if his Irish sites. They are O. edulis shells from a small shell midden with samples of mixed preservation. As it is often the case, the hinges were better preserved than other parts, so I went ahead and made sections through left and right valves, which both worked fairly well.</p>
    <p>I will not go into each analysed shell but instead show 3 of the specimens that are representative of the various Mg/Ca patterns that I have seen in the overall assemblage.</p>
    <p name="Irish_Oysters">With further research, I hope to figure out, what elemental distribution is typical or most common in Oyster shells and get a general idea, to then make better interpretations of individual shell-records.</p>

      <p>Generally, there are probably two factors that can explain the Mg/Ca ratio in these shells:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the organic component that is found in higher concentrations within the (often) annual growth lines (the laser does not separate between the organic and the inorganic component of the shell, so there is little we can do to avoid these); </li>
          <li>increases in growth rate (shoutout to Harry Robson (University of York), who saw the same patterns of growth in his Danish oysters). (also check out <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018217300421">Durham et al. 2017</a>)</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Additionally, there are some spatial distributions of Mg/Ca that are not as common but still turn up in a lot of shells. In some specimens I found a shift from consistently low Mg/Ca ratios to regular and gradual increases of Mg/Ca after 2 years of growth. I don't know enough about oyster maturation but maybe there's something going on here?</p>
      <p>Also, almost every specimen has increased Mg/Ca ratios along the outside of the hinge. At first I tried to explain this with an increased growth rate in this region, as it is usually thicker than other parts of the shell, but it doesn't hold up everywhere. Something else must also be going on here.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17307010?via%3Dihub">Mouchi et al.</a>  talk about offsets of temperature curves from six archaeological oysters. They tentatively link the different Mg/Ca ranges to different marine/freshwater conditions, but their values could also be explained by the above factors, which are only visible when mapping the elemental composition or sampling in different parts of the same increment, which rarely happens.</p>
      <p>Altogether, I think with LIBS we can provide a quick indicator for season of death, but I would probably want to still base that on a modern reference study, where we actually know when the specimens died, rather than an archaeological assemblage. Since the Mg/Ca ratios here are not clearly linked to temperature, their interpretation for season of death would be similar to the analysis of growth increments à la <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440300906186">Milner</a> and not as straightforward as temperature records. So the training is going to be a wee bit more intensive and the interpretation potentially more subjective as well. Hopefully, once we know more about Irish oysters, we can come back and interpret the archaeological samples in more detail.</p>
      <p>The next update will be on some limpets, which is always fun!

  <h2>Mg/Ca ratios in Californian mussels</h2>
  <p>After meeting <a href="https://www.unr.edu/anthropology/people/faculty/christopher-jazwa">Christopher Jazwa</a> (Assistant Professor, University of Nevada) at the SAAs earlier this year, he sent me some of his <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_mussel">Mytilus californianus</a></em> shells to play with and test our LIBS system on.</p>
  <p>I will not go into each analysed shell but instead show 3 of the specimens that are representative of the various Mg/Ca patterns that I have seen in the overall assemblage.</p>
  <p>The shells are from <a href="https://www.unr.edu/anthropology/people/faculty/christopher-jazwa/californias-channel-islands">Santa Rosa Island</a>, which is known for its abundance of shell middens (albeit less entertaining than the middens on <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/1YQB-Q2BR-UK2L-AADJ">San Miguel Island</a>). Santa Rosa middens and their shells are a massive source for climate data ranging back into the Mid-Holocene and provide first hand insights into the human exploitation of marine shells.</p>

    <p>Christopher analyses the shell's geochemical properties, because these can change as a result of environmental change. The shells that Chris sent over were modern shells that he previously analysed using stable isotope measurements (δ18O) to see what environmental change generally looks like within the records of Californian musses from Santa Rosa.</p>

    <p>Now we wanted to see, what the ratio of Magnesium to Calcium in the shell can tell us.</p>
    <p>Mg/Ca ratios are regularly tested to see whether they can be used for reconstructing water temperatures, but are also often shown to be not very reliable. So mapping the Mg/Ca ratios using LIBS would give us pretty a good idea of what's going on in this case. Our new setup uses a combination of cleaning shots and measurement shots. Cleaning shots that take off ~0.1µg from the surface and expose fresh carbonate, while measurement shots actually measure Magnesium and Calcium concentrations,  using our trusted peaks of Mg and calcium ions with their respective wavelengths of 279 nm and Ca ions at 315 nm. The intensity of both peaks is based on the intensity of emitted photons with the above wavelengths. With each shot we create a plasma that emits photons based on the plasma's elemental composition. That way we can get a linear correlation between the peaks' intensities and the actual Mg/Ca ratio within the material.</p>

  <div class="col-lg-8">
    <p>Looking at the shells in general, there are two layers of the shell that grow pretty much in sync. One is made of calcite (coloured) and one is made of aragonite (black). The reason why the aragonitic (or inner) layer is black, is because it contains a much lower ratio of Mg to Ca and can pretty easily be identified this way.</p>
    <p>The calcitic (or outer) layer of the shell has Mg/Ca ratios that range between 0.05 and 0.25.</p>
    <p>Another thing that became clear is that all shells are different. These differences range from trivial things, like the holes from Christopher's earlier drilling for carbonate samples in January's shell #1, to less trivial things like growth interruptions and mixing of calcite and aragonite layers in May's shells #2 and #3.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="./img/musselData3.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-8">
    <p>The inconsistent way that these layers are mixed, makes them very difficult to analyse and to track changes in element concentration through time (so I didn't )</p>
    <p>The Mg/Ca ratio is mostly consistent within growth increments, which suggests that whatever controls the ratio is doing this at the point in time that the growth specific increments represent. This is different from the high and low ratios we find in the calcite and aragonite parts which grew at the same time, because their respective mineralogies are already biased towards one way or the other.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="./img/musselData4.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-8"style="display: none;">
    <p>While all shells show some kind of banding patterns with high and low Mg/Ca ratios, these bands are not consistently distinct in all specimens. For comparison, there is map of a shell further below, with very distinct patterns from Christopher's March collection.</p>
    <p>How come this distinctiveness is not always the case? - I don't know.</p>
    <p>Could this be age related, since bands are getting gradually more distinct in this shell? - We'll need more older shells to determine this. What could the Mg/Ca increases actually mean? - Tentatively, it could be argued that they are seasonal patterns that happen every year and high Mg/Ca ratios in one shell relate to similar times in another shell (stroked lines illustrate this). Sadly the inconsistency of the patterns, especially in shells from May, makes this a somewhat useless bit of information, which can't be relied on.</p>
    <p>More importantly, the concept that Mg/Ca is mostly temperature related is seemingly not the case in our samples, because a) the factors behind the distortion of patterns are clearly in control of Mg/Ca ratios and dominate the record and b) the Mg/Ca ratios measured at the shell edges of January shells have a higher Mg/Ca ratio than the May shells, where water temperature (and thus Mg/Ca ratios) should be warmer.</p>
    <p>This preliminary data leaves us with more questions to solve next:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Are the distinctly high-ratio bands related to seasonal change?</li>
        <li>What causes the higher amounts of Mg/Ca in those bands (seasonal or structural factors)?</li>
        <li>Can the banding patterns be used to guide sampling for stable isotope analysis?</li>
        <li>What causes irregularities or the lack of them?</li>
        <li>Can these causes be anticipated by distinct exterior features of the shell?</li>
        <li>Are irregularities more prominent in younger shells/younger parts of old shells?</li>
      </ul>
    <p>To answer this, we'll need many more shells to find common features and additional contextual information to characterise them.</p>
    <p>Until soon,</p>

    <h2>New paper on elemental mapping of Shells using LIBS</h2>
    <p>We are happy to announce the first major publication of the ACCELERATE Project: Elemental mapping of Mg/Ca intensity ratios in marine mollusc shells using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy in the Journal of Atomic and Analytical Spectroscopy.</p>
    <p>In this paper we showcase our LIBS setup to carry out a rapid analysis of the elemental composition of shell carbonate, with over 2,000 sampling points per hour and little to no sample preparation.</p>
    <p>We tested the LIBS setup using sections of three mollusc shells (Conomurex fasciatus, Ostrea edulis, Anomalocardia flexuosa) and successfully mapped the Mg/Ca ratio within them.</p>
    <p>Our next step is to make the setup more user friendly and for it to easily provide the analysis of various selected elemental ratios.</p>

    <h2>Resampling of C. fasciatus shell with improved setup</h2>
    <p>Here is a quick update on the most recent changes to our LIBS setup and a newer map of elemental ratios (Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca) from our Conomurex fasciatus shell recently published in <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2017/JA/C7JA00131B#!divAbstract">JAAS</a>.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p name="fasciatus">The preliminary verdict here is that C. fasciatus from the Farasan Islands still remain difficult to interpret and are far from being used as a seasonality proxy. A more detailed report that compares the elemental ratios with stable oxygen isotopes is currently under review and I'll post it here when it comes out.</p>

      <p>Our LIBS setup now uses a new focusing lens for infrared light and with 10x magnification, which decreases our sampling area to a diameter of ~40 µm. We also added a cleaning step before measuring each location, by simply using a number of shots that ablate the material at the surface and expose "fresh" carbonate. The sampling rate has been improved somewhat, by simply taking less spectra per location. The peaks for Mg at 279.6 nm and for Ca at 315.9 nm are actually clear enough to map shells with a single spectrum instead of our usual 10 spectra per location. That way we can get almost 4,500 sample points per hour (0.81s/point). Previously this was 2,100 sample points per hour. Sadly, the Sr peak at 407.8 nm is less clear and single spectra are too variable for my taste, which is why 3 spectra per sample point seemed more appropriate, when measuring Sr/Ca. Sampling rate here is about 3,600 per hour (1s/spot).</p>
      <p>These numbers can still be improved by using newer equipment (ours is on average 15 years old). Right now the biggest problem is our pretty old computer and the fact, that the sample stages do not move constantly, but stop at each point to take one or more spectra. Single spectra analysis of Mg/Ca could allow us to have the stages move at a constant speed and make full use of our 10 Hz laser. That way we could achieve an almost tenfold increase in speed (not counting the cleaning step). So that is something to aim for before the end of the project in 10 months(!).</p>
      <p>I was hoping to update this project more frequently, but in the next few weeks, I'll be busy with collecting more samples in Denmark as well as with Matthew Meredith-Williams in Melbourne. But I am looking forward to sharing new data as soon as it becomes available. Until then!</p>

    <h2>Preliminary results and update on the ACCELERATE Project</h2>
    <p>Generally, having more data points per shell or the ability to have more shells per site, has a lot of advantages. Firstly, it was shown that a large number of samples per shell increases the temporal resolution and thus allows us to determine the season of exploitation more accurately (Jew et al., 2013a, 2013b). Secondly, it is necessary to have a representative number of shells per site to determine a general site-seasonality (Thomas, 2015). Lastly, shells can also be used to create a seasonal structure for a layer or context, enhancing our understanding of site formation process or the use of artefacts (Hausmann and Meredith-Williams, 2016; Thompson and Andrus, 2011).</p>
    <p name="update">With these future applications in mind, I have worked on an experimental setup that allows the quick analysis of elemental ratios and their relation to environmental changes during the mollusc’s lifetime. In some cases, the ratios between elements (e.g. Mg, Sr, Ba ) and Ca have been linked to changes in environmental conditions, notably temperature and salinity, although other interplaying factors make more general statements very difficult (Graniero et al., 2017).</p>

      <p>To test the performance of my experimental setup, I analysed three shells of marine and lagunar mollusc species, including one gastropod and two bivalves: a fragment of the aperture lip of Conomurex fasciatus (Born 1778), a hinge of Ostrea edulis (Linnaeus 1758), and one complete half of Anomalocardia flexuosa (Linnaeus 1767) from a modern context. The shells are associated with three different sites, from different periods and different regions of the world. The aim here was not to compare three records of the same environment, but to test the experimental setup on a variety of species</p>

    <h3>Method</h3>
      <p>LIBS is a simple, straightforward and versatile technique for rapid analysis of the chemical composition of a huge variety of materials (Harmon et al., 2013). It is based on the atomic emission spectroscopy of plasma, generated by focusing a high intensity laser beam onto the material. The plasma emission is collected and then spectrally resolved. This provides qualitative and quantitative results indicated by the emission line intensities of the elemental constituents of the material.</p>

        <p>In the examples here, I chose to measure the intensities of emission lines which correspond to ions of the elements Mg and Ca. The ratios calculated reflect the intensities of specific emission lines and do not directly translate into ratios based on weight or molar ratios, although the relationship is somewhat linear. Hence the ‘intensity-ratios’ here are reported in arbitrary units (a.u.).</p>
        <p>The setup’s acquisition process was programmed using LabView software (www.ni.com/labview/) and is divided into two phases (indicated by red and blue arrows in Fig. 1). In the first phase (red), multiple target locations or waypoints are being selected by moving the sample stage to the preferred location, which is visible through the camera. The sample locations are then interpolated between the two (or more) waypoints at a given interval (here 100µm) and put down in a list.</p>
        <p>In the second phase, the motorised stage goes through the list of pre-selected sample locations, while acquiring LIBS spectra at each location with an irradiation area of ~90µm in diameter. In each spectrum the mean ratio of the intensity of the two pre selected peaks is calculated and then assigned to the corresponding sample location in the list.</p>
        <p>There are two modes that can be chosen from for the second phase of acquisition. The first mode (accumulation) calculates the ratio of selected peaks in a single ‘accumulated’ spectrum which is an accumulation of several spectra (here 10) in one location. The second mode (single shot) calculates the ratio of selected peaks in each of the 10 spectra separately. While the resulting mean ratio is identical, the two modes have different advantages. The accumulation mode has a faster performance because only one spectrum needs to be analysed, whereas the single shot mode allows the user to assess the standard deviation of the 10 spectra to provide an error for the mean value. As such, the accumulation mode is more suitable for spatially mapping elemental ratios and the single shot mode is more suitable for tracking changes along the direction of growth and thus through time. The typical time spend in one sample location is about 1.7 seconds in accumulation mode and 2.4 seconds in single shot mode. With this configuration a typical analysis of 5 cm translates into 500 sample locations (5,000 spectra) and would required a time of acquisition of about 14 minutes (20 min in single shot mode).</p>
      <h3>Experiments</h3>
        <p>For the experiment, I used three samples. In all three cases the shell had previously been sectioned along the direction of growth and thus provided a flat surface for me to analyse.</p>
        <p>The sections were analysed in both modes (Fig. 2). First, I created a map of the elemental ratios by using the accumulation mode. This allowed me to get a good idea of larger trends in the elemental composition of the shell and to identify patterns that are likely not related to environmental change. Only afterwards I selected an area of interest (black lines) that was analysed in the more detailed single shot mode following the direction of growth.</p>
        <p>All three shells produced Mg/Ca intensity ratios that described somewhat cyclical patterns, as is expected when analysing records on a seasonal scale. However, all specimens also had isochronous parts within the same growth increments where the values would deviate from the general cyclical trend, indicating that other factors control the elemental ratio as well (Marali et al., in press).</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p>In C. fasciatus, the single shot mode shows high values at a 0–2 mm distance to the shell edge, with a short decrease at 0.3 mm, before a larger decrease from 0.09 Mg/Ca to 0.04 Mg/Ca at 3.0 mm. Afterwards, there is an increase to above 0.10 Mg/Ca over the next 4 mm. Despite this being the general trend within the sample, the map of ratios shows quite clearly that some parts outside the sampling path of the linear measurement (black line) deviate from those values. Similar spatial trends were found by Poulain et al. (2015) in Ruditapes philippinarum and indicate a non-environmental influence.</p>
        <p>The O. edulis sample shows similar results. Measuring along the direction of growth in single shot mode, a repetitive pattern is apparent with peaks at at ~0.17 Mg/Ca and lows at ~0.11 Mg/Ca. However, the map shows areas in the top right that generally produce higher values than areas in the bottom left, even though the areas cover increments that grew at the same time. This could be explained with the averaging of growth increments in the bottom left of the map, that are too thin to be sampled individually. Potentially high values could be mixed together with other thin growth increments that produce lower values (Shirai et al., 2014). However, this effect would also prevent extremely low values, which were still reached.</p>
        <p>Variations of Mg/Ca values outside the linear sampling path were also found in A. flexuosa. The mapped ratios separate the shell section into three parallel growing layers (interior, centre, and exterior). Albeit growing at the same time, they almost consistently produce different Mg/Ca values, with the central one having higher values than the others. Similar ‘zonation’ was found by Lazareth et al. (2013) in Protothaca thaca and Freitas et al. (2009) in Mytilus edulis as well as Pecten maximus, who suggest sampling P. maximus within the mid-regions of the shells for more consistent environmental proxy data.</p>
        <p>The reason behind the spatial patterns in isochronous parts of the shells analysed above requires more thorough analyses, before they can be used as seasonal or environmental proxy. Although there are cyclical variations that could well be controlled directly or indirectly by seasonal environmental change, it will be necessary to clearly link element/Ca ratios to specific changes. Otherwise it will be difficult to apply the same seasonal control to archaeological specimens and make consistent interpretations of the archaeological dataset.</p>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>With these experiments I showed the application of an automated LIBS setup to acquire elemental ratios from in situ shell carbonate. This was realised with the use of a LIBS imaging setup that offered a spatial resolution at a scale of ~100 µm and an acquisition speed of ~20,000 spectra/h. The setup proved the feasibility of efficiently acquiring elemental ratios from shell carbonates using LIBS, which will directly translate into lower costs per data point.</p>
      <p>However, I have not yet linked the elemental ratios of the LIBS values to distinct environmental change, although cyclical changes were visible that suggest seasonal patterning. A validation based on modern shells and contemporaneous environmental data is still needed to fully make a case for the use of the presented elemental ratios as seasonal proxies.</p>
      <p>This will be the next step of the ACCELERATE project. The variability of the elemental ratios in isochronous parts will make this more difficult and it is likely that different solutions need to be found for different shell species and environments. That said, the possibility to quickly assess elemental ratios will be beneficial in carrying out the analyses of more shell specimens in a shorter time frame than previously possible.</p>

    <h2>Niklas Hausmann gives guest lecture at the University of Crete</h2>
    <p>Niklas Hausmann delivered a guest lecture at the Department of History and Archaeology at the University of Crete in Rethymno on 9th December 2016 entitled "Prehistoric coastal exploitation on the Farasan Islands, Saudi Arabia".</p>
    <p>In his lecture Niklas described the outcomes of his PhD thesis that he finished at the University of York last year as a part of the ERC Project DISPERSE. The project aimed to study the dispersal of humans between Africa and Arabia, with a focus on the southern Red Sea as a gateway out of Africa. Niklas's research is based on excavations on the Holocene shell midden sites on the Farasan Islands, Saudi Arabia. He carried out a pilot study on the ecology of the marine gastropod Conomurex fasciatus, the main component of the shell middens, to understand the human exploitation of the marine resources. His study used the analysis of growth increments as well as stable oxygen and carbon isotopes of the shell carbonate. The results helped to understand seasonal growth patterns and isotope composition of the shells, which can be applied to seasonal patterns of mollusc consumption and human mobility.</p>
    <p>The results of his PhD showed a strong reliance on marine resources and a intense exploitation of C. fasciatus in particular. They also showed that seasonal grouping of shells within midden layers can occur, which can help to further analyse the processes behind shell midden construction. However, this makes it necessary to increase the amount of samples that are analysed per layer, which is time consuming and often too costly.</p>
    <p>In the final part of his lecture Niklas presented initial results from his current research project ACCELERATE at the Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas in the Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser. The project aims to produce seasonal signals from shell carbonate using the rapid technique of elemental analysis, Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy.</p>

    <h2>New paper shows the importance of high-res seasonality data</h2>
    <p>Our paper, Exploring Accumulation Rates of Shell Deposits Through Seasonality Data was recently published in the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory. It explores the use of seasonality data combined with stratigraphic information to find distinct groups of shells that were deposited (eaten) at the same time and as the same meal.</p>
    <p>Finding these pockets of meals will help to reconstruct the temporal scaffolds of shell midden sites.</p>
    <p>One necessity for answering these questions is the availability of large amounts of seasonality values. The core objective of the ACCELERATE Project.</p>
